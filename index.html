            <h1>About</h1>
            <p class="lead"><strong>My name is Ethan Ngawaka, I am a young junior software engineer in my second year of an honours in Computer Science at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). </strong></p>
            <p>I fell in love with programming 8 years ago, making small games and prototypes in Python using Pygame. I have never lost my passion for game development but have since branched out into different areas of software development including simple full stack web development and desktop application development.</p>
            <p>I love breaking down and understanding systems which is why I've been so drawn to game development as it covers so many challenging aspects of software. User input, satisfying feedback, general ease of use, aesthetics, and complex interlocking systems which are fundamental to most games keep me coming back again and again.</p>
            <p>I also have a passion for mathematics and physics, studying as much as I can in my spare time. This love for maths earned me various awards during my last years of highschool including the Edward Hutley Bursary for Maths award in 2022.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Below are a series of projects completed for myself or a freelance client each showcasing; some images from the project, a list of technologies, a retrospective/reflection, and a link to source code or a place to view the project.</strong></p>

                    <p>This is by far my largest project to date and the one I am most proud of. The game showcases many complex systems working together in harmony, being an incremental roguelike with upgrades, abilities, shops, waves, and unique enemies and mini-bosses. This was also my first game using Pygame in a long time, and I feel even in it's unfinished state I've almost pushed it to it's limits with a handbuilt UI system, scene managing, and shaders being just a few examples of this.</p>

                    <p>This was my first foray into C++ and the technologies surrounding it. I ended up making a (looking back, quite terrible) game engine that handled 3D physics, vertex rendering with OpenGL, shaders, and mesh loading and handling. This was probably the most challenging experience by far, while very rewarding I should have learned the fundamentals of C++ before trying this.</p>

                    <p>Growth Factor was a bit of a dissapointing one, I focused way too much on making the shooting feel good and aesthetics of the game that it ended up feeling pretty bad to play.

                    <p>This game was made for use in an escape room, with a series of puzzles and riddles with answers tied to real life clues. This was quite fun and I am quite proud of the way it turned out looking. While it doesn't make much sense outside the context of the escape room it is still a great demonstration of my abilities.</p>
